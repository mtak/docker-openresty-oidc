# Openresty-oidc

Openresty (Debian 12) based container that includes the following modules:

- lua-resty-http
- lua-resty-session
- lua-resty-openidc

Note that this doesn't actually run as the config isn't valid (no certs).

See [Openresty](https://hub.docker.com/r/openresty/openresty) for usage docs.
